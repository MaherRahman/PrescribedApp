# PrescribedApp
Making an app for Dell Medical School

The purpose of this app is to allow Doctors to "prescribe" it as a form of information to their patients. 
as it stands currently, there is a lot of misinformation out there for patients to stumble upon, and become misinformed about their treatment. 
This app serves as a way for the Doctor to essentially "Prescribe" curated information regarding the patients treatment, and essentially allow the patient to access extra information, without falling prey to misinformation in the webs. 

Can use the database from other medical resources and apps such as Archimedes 360. 

Since I don't have access to apple products, I'm mainly gearing this app for Android using Java, Kotlin instead of IOSSwift, but maybe if this app turns out useful I may opt to make it IOS compatible as well
